# Ice Breaker

Project 03 - Juicy Brick Breaker

Date: 10/12/2022

A very simple brick breaker game with tons of visual effects. A play on an "icebreaker", a term used for introductions. Has lots of "ice" puns.

## Future Development

Make more music and learn a bit of music theory. Implement more levels and more of my own work. Play around with more features. Use visual effects appropriately; not too little, not too much.
